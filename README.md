# AppRun Course 2021 - WIP

## About AppRun

[AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun) is an open-source JavaScript library that is small but powerful. AppRun is not well known by the developer community yet. However, developers like it once they learn about it. Apress published a book about it when the editor found it.

## About this Course

The target audience of this course is beginner web developers who are interested in building high-performance frontend applications. This course is also for students who already have some knowledge of other modern JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, and are looking for a lightweight alternative.

This course is not an ordinary coding course that shows some hello-world like toy apps. It has a practice project to mimic real business applications aiming to bring web developers to a professional level.

1. A single page App that has a professional user interface
2. Back-end data access through REST API and GraphQL
3. Manage security through OAuth using Github/Gists as an example
